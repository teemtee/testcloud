.SH NAME
testcloud \- download \fIqcow2\fR cloud images and boot them locally.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtestcloud\fR [-h, --help] [COMMAND]... [OPTION]... [SUBCOMMAND]... [OPTION]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBtestcloud\fR is a small helper script to download and boot cloud images on your machine locally.
Currently, only Fedora \fBqcow2\fR images are supported.
.PP
To run \fBtestcloud\fR, you need to provide the \fBURL\fR of a cloud image or string in \fBfedora:XX\fR format
to the script which will be used for booting.

If you do not have an image location of your own, you can use one
of the images from the \fBFedora Cloud\fR download pages at \fIhttps://alt.fedoraproject.org/cloud/\fR.
.PP
Then, \fBtestcloud\fR will download the image and save it in the \fI/var/lib/testcloud/backingstores/\fR.
It will use this image to create a backing store for a newly created instance which will be placed in
\fI/var/tmp/instances/\fR. When the same image has been previously downloaded, \fBtestcloud\fR will NOT
download it again and it will use the current image to create the instance.
.PP
When the new instance is created, \fBtestcloud\fR will show its IP address that you can use to
access the running instance via \fIssh\fR. The login name is \fBfedora\fR and the password is
\fBpassw0rd\fR. The IP address of an instance is shown when you list the instance (see COMMANDS).
.PP
The instance can also be manipulated and controlled with \fBvirt-manager\fR.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The default configuration should work for many people. However, if you need to override the
default settings, you can do it in the \fIsettings.py\fR file. The example file in
\fIconf/settings-example.py\fR shows the available configuration values which you can
alter to suit your needs.
.PP
The configuration file must be placed in one of the following locations in order to be
recognized.
.IP
\fIconf/settings.py\fR in the git checkout
.IP
\fI~/.config/testcloud/settings.py\fR
.IP
\fI/etc/testcloud/settings.py\fR
.SH COMMANDS

        Set the amount of RAM that will be available to the instance's VM (in MiB).

\fB--disksize DISKSIZE\fR
        Set the disk size of the instance VM (in GiB).

\fB--vnc\fR
        Open a VNC connection to the \fB:1\fR display of the instance VM.

\fB--no-graphic\fR
        Turn off the instance VM's graphical display.
